<h4>Preface</h4>
<p>On this page, some texts about programming in the languages Perl, Python and C, and about computing in general can be found.
<p>When in the early days of "web 1.0" it became possible to publish any kind of text, I created a website and uploaded some content. It seemed, I was more interested in writing non-fictional texts instead of stories or novels. Over time it turned out, I mainly liked writing about computer subjects. I then also tried to learn programming. I kept my notes about that in HTML format, and at some point, I uploaded them to <a href="https://hlubenow.lima-city.de">my website</a> too.
<br>Later, when I created a <a href="https://github.com/hlubenow/">GitHub-account</a> and found out, that you could also have a website on GitHub, I thought, my texts about programming could also fit into this concept. So here they are.
<p>It should be mentioned, that this is just a hobbyist's page. Unfortunately I'm not a professional programmer or computer scientist, so the texts below are just the notes I took, while trying to teach myself programming. I wrote down, what worked for me, but you probably shouldn't rely on my notes, when doing serious work or learning for college exams. So be aware, that you are using at your own risk, whatever can be found here.

<p>Here are some pages with notes on Pascal and C. I just uploaded them, although I'm far from being an expert in these languages.
I put some effort into learning C (and the pages about it here), but it seems, it takes even more effort to really become a C programmer.
